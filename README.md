My goal with this project is to develop a program that can load the `Game/world/Map/Map_000X.dat` files extracted from the game with a tool like [ChronoMod](https://github.com/jimzrt/ChronoMod) or CT Explore, along with the respective "Worldchip" files.

Currently, we can load the maps in runtime but the Worldchip files need to be manually set up in the Godot project. The current version cannot modify anything.

I chose to use Godot because when you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Which is to say, I'm better at making stuff with game engines than with typical GUI frameworks like Qt.
