My goal with this project is to develop a program that can load the `Game/world/Map/Map_000X.dat` files extracted from the game with a tool like [ChronoMod](https://github.com/jimzrt/ChronoMod) or CT Explore, along with the respective "Worldchip" files.

Currently, we can load the maps in runtime, then we load the worldchip files separately.

I chose to use Godot because when you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Which is to say, I'm better at making stuff with game engines than with typical GUI frameworks like Qt.
